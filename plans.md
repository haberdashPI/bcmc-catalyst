source the mailchimp campaigns and create a webhook

Essential for meeting:

Next steps:
1. create the donation link
2. have the event calendar invalidate its cache after a
    reasonable amount of time
3. fix calendar coloring in dark mode (or just always use light mode)
4. fix formatting of event description (maybe insert various elements
    if they are present: e.g. Zoom Meeting, etc...)
5. display list of mailchimp newsletters
6. unify form creation into a single form builder object
7. use my own backend (via Netlify Lambda functions) to
   handle form submission
